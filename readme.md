## ASL-LEX

#### About
ASL-LEX is a database of lexical and phonological properties of nearly 3,000 signs in American Sign Language. This project is a collaboration between [the Laboratory for Language and Cognitive Neuroscience at San Diego State](http://emmoreylab.sdsu.edu/) University and the [Psycholinguistics and Linguistics Lab at Tufts University](http://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/psycholinglab/). ASL-LEX is a searchable database of subjective frequency ratings, iconicity ratings, lexical properties (e.g., initialized signs; lexical class), and six phonological features from which neighborhood densities have been calculated. ASL-LEX also provides, reference video clips, English translations and, for a subset of signs, alternative translations.
